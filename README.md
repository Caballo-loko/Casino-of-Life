# Casino of Life

Casino of Life is a decentralized application running on the Solana blockchain that combines retro gaming, AI, and blockchain technology to create a unique betting and AI training platform.

## Features

- Emulator for AI agents to compete in retro fighting games
- Betting system for users to wager on AI agent fights
- NFT minting for AI agents, allowing users to own and collect their trained agents
- User collections for storing and managing AI agent NFTs
- Dashboard for analyzing agent performance and learning progress

## Technology Stack

- Solana blockchain
- stable-retro (a fork of gym-retro) for retro game emulation
- AI/Machine Learning (Stable Baselines, Reinforcement Learning)
- NFT technology
- FreeDUMBS SPL token for transactions

## Application Overview

Casino of Life consists of three main components:

1. **Fight Arena (Emulator & Betting Interface)**
   - Displays upcoming AI battles in an emulator
   - Allows users to place bets on specific fighters and fights
   - Provides real-time updates on battles and betting odds

2. **Agent Registry & Dashboard**
   - Lists all AI agents with their respective metrics and dynamics
   - Provides detailed analytics on each agent, including training data, win rates, and other key statistics
   - Allows users to mint new AI agents and add them to their collection

3. **Marketplace**
   - Facilitates buying, selling, and trading of AI agents using FreeDUMBS tokens
   - Provides users with detailed transaction histories and market analytics

## How It Works

1. Users can train AI agents using reinforcement learning strategies.
2. Trained agents can be minted as NFTs and added to the user's collection.
3. AI agents compete in emulated retro fighting games.
4. Users can bet on the outcomes of these AI fights.
5. The dashboard provides analytics and insights into agent performance and learning.

## Usage

### Supported Games
Currently, the platform supports the following Sega Genesis games:
- Mortal Kombat 1, 2, and 3
- Street Fighter
- Wrestlemania

### Training Agents
Users can pre-train their agents using popular reinforcement learning strategies such as:
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- PPO2
- A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)
- Q-learning

The Farama Foundation's stable-retro library, a fork of gym-retro, is recommended for early users to train their agents before bringing them to the Casino of Life.

### Participating in Fights
1. Browse upcoming fights in the Fight Arena.
2. Place bets on your chosen AI agent using FreeDUMBS tokens.
3. Watch the fight in real-time through the integrated emulator.
4. Collect winnings if your bet is successful.

### Agent Economics
- Agents can earn tokens for their users through successful fights.
- Tokens can be burned to keep agents fighting, as part of the internal reward system for learning.

### Analyzing Results
Use the Agent Registry & Dashboard to:
- View detailed performance metrics for your agents
- Analyze learning progress and win rates
- Make informed decisions on training strategies and marketplace activities
